# Why did I make this?

To make sure everyone feels safe using this bot, I open sourced it

To be honest, this code is not forkable, since the one vscode extension that supported syncing VSCode -> BDFD is deprecated.
This is just for open sourceability i guess, so you can look through the code if you know BDScript
